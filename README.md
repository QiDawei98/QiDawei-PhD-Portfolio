# QiDawei-PhD-Portfolio
This repository contains my CV and supplementary materials for my PhD application. Below are two of my key software projects.

### Crystal Field Analysis
A program designed to fit crystal field Hamiltonian[^1] to reproduce energy levels obtained from optical spectroscopy. This program is a wrapper for PyCrystalField[^2]. I've expanded its capabilities to include excited states, among other improvements, to make it work out of the box. I am currently preparing a manuscript on this work for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. This program is available [here](https://github.com/QiDawei98/YouZhiSan).

### NCI Analysis
A co-authored program performing Non Covalent Interactions index[^3](NCI) from VASP calculated results. We designed a new algorithm to accurately obtain the derivative of electron density. An example of its output is also included in this repository. This program is available [here](https://github.com/QiDawei98/Flower_Lane).

For more details, please refer to the PDFs. Thank you for your consideration.
